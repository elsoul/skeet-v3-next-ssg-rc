The Skeet Dev team is currently progressing with the development of v3 of our TypeScript serverless framework üõ†

## Skeet v3

In v3, we are transitioning our infrastructure to Cloudflare and diving into the world of edge computing üöÄ

Today, we are excited to release a demo app for AI chat powered by the ChatGPT (GPT-4o) API operating on edge runtime!

Check out the Skeet v3 AI Chat Demo here: https://skeet-v3-next-edge-rc.pages.dev/

With Skeet v3, anyone can deploy this demo app instantly, with the flexibility to customize and develop their applications as needed. It supports all web app developments and plans to add templates specialized for blogs and Web3.

Traditional architectures using servers or containers, for example, would route traffic through network cables from Brazil to an application hosted in Japan, crossing the globe. Network cables, like roads, have limited bandwidth which often leads to congestion and slows down overall speed.

Edge computing avoids the need to access servers across the globe by running applications on the nearest edge server to the user, significantly improving network congestion and response times.

The adoption of edge computing by many applications will enhance global network quality, allow eco-friendly application execution, and further improve performance.

All apps created with Skeet v3 will operate on edge runtime, fully compatible with edge computing.

Additionally, we offer native multilingual support, utilize the Next.js App Router making component management simpler, and have made enhancements in manageability. The React Compiler now automates the performance optimization of components through memoization, and the Magic Link feature enhances security with password-less logins. With Cloudflare D1 & Neon + Prisma, we facilitate coexistence between edge databases and a more stable serverless Postgres.

Previously, we had container APIs for migration management; now, Prisma operates on edge runtime. Both frontend Server Actions and Server Components, and backend Cloudflare workers, can access the database from any edge runtime.

With Skeet v3, all of these are easily managed within a monorepo setup.

Furthermore, apps deployed with Skeet v3 run on 100% renewable energy and can be certified by the Green Web Foundation (GWF).

As more transitions to Skeet v3 occur, we move closer to a greener internet.

Let's advance green coding practices to ensure an environmentally friendly internet operation. üçÄ

Stay tuned for more innovations from Skeet!
